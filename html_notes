Codecademy HTML Notes:

  NOTE: Throughout document ellipsis (...) is used to indicate text/links to be filled in

- Always include <!DOCTYPE html> as first line of page to ensure correct interpretation by browser

- Opening and closing tags provide further instruction to browser (Inline tages have form <cmd /> where cmd = command to be named)
  - <!-- ... --> will allow for comments in code
  - <html> ... </html> always needed to indicate bounds of html code
  - <head> ... </head> contains header information (i.e. page name, page logo)
    - <title> ... </title> used to give webpage title
  - <body> ... </body> indicates main body of webpage code
    - <hi> ... </hi> where i is {1,2,3,4,5,6} will create various sized headers for different sections
    - <p> ... </p> will create new paragraph of text
      - <br /> will create line break within block of text

      - adding certain code to tag will allow for linking within page
    - <img src="..." /> will insert image
      - adding alt="..." will provide image description if image fails to load; also used for diabaility assistance programs
    - <video src="..."> ... </video> will insert video into page
      - height, width, controls labels often inserted into opening tage to control size, function of video
      - typically "Video Not Supported" text is inserted b/w opening and closing tags in case video doesn't load
    - <a href="..."> ... </a> creates a link; can be wrapped around images to create links as well
      - include target=_blank option to open link in new tab/window
    - <ul> ... </ul> creates unordered (bullet pointed) list
    - <ol> ... </ol> creates ordered (numbered) list
      - both list types use <li> ... </li> to create new list items
    - <table> ... </table> creates a new table
      - <th> ... </th> create table headers
        - scope="row/col" argument tells browser where header belongs
        - colspan="n" option allows header to span n columns
        - rowspan="n" option allows header to span n rows (useful for long headers)
      - <tr> ... </tr> creates new table row
      - <td> ... </td> creates new cell for table data
        - NOTE: Each data cell must be individually created using the tags above; row and column tags do not create cells
      - <tbody> ... </tbody> command allows us to section off table for better management of long, unruly tables
        - <thread> ... </thread> creates sections
      - <tfoot> ... </tfoot> creates footer
